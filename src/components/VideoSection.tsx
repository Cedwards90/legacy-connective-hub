              This powerful documentary showcases the heart and resilience of West Garfield Park, highlighting both our challenges and our unwavering spirit. The 13-year life expectancy gap between our community and downtown Chicago isn't just a statisticâ€”it's a call to action that drives our mission at Legacy Families.

              Through initiatives like the Sankofa Wellness Village, we're working to bridge this gap by creating spaces that promote health, economic opportunity, and community wellbeing. This video represents the voices of our community members and reinforces why our work is so crucial for preserving and uplifting West Garfield Park's legacy.
