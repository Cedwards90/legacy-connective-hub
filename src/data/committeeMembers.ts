    bio: "I am the second generation of four born and raised on the west side of Chicago in the area most commonly known as West Garfield Park. I currently work for Cook County and have joined The LEGACY FAMILIES OF WEST GARFIELD PARK as a Community Organizer. I have dwelled in the West Garfield Park area for over 5 decades, I have always had a heart for my People and my Community. I have been witness to both the Good and the Bad things that have happened in and to West Garfield Park. It is my Mission in my Adult life to help Empower my People and my Community. It is Important that I leave behind a Legacy that will ensure that the future of West Garfield Park neighborhood includes those who live here, and have here for decades. That the development that is about to/taking place in West Garfield Park does not lead to exclusion or displacement of the People who call this place home. I stand ready to fight to ensure that the legacy of West Garfield Park not only reflects those who will migrate to the area due to Gentrification ... but also those who were here, have roots and generations of history here, remain here! Welcoming a future West Garfield Park neighborhood that provides Growth for ALL."
